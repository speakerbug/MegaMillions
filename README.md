# Mega Millions

I based this script off of the one I wrote for [Powerball](https://github.com/speakerbug/Powerball).

# Usage

Edit the file `tickets.txt` with the numbers you have purchased where the yellow ball is the last number.

```bash
$ python megamillions.py <winning white balls> <winning yellow ball>
```
